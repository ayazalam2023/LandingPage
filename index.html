                        Arabic is a Semitic language spoken by over 400 million people across the Middle East and North Africa. It has classical and modern forms, with Classical Arabic being the language of the Qur'an, and Modern Standard Arabic used in formal contexts. Arabic's rich vocabulary and complex grammar make it unique, and it has contributed significantly to science, mathematics, and philosophy. It is written from right to left, and its script is known for its flowing, artistic calligraphy.

                        Urdu is an Indo-Aryan language spoken primarily in Pakistan and India, with over 100 million speakers globally. It evolved during the Mughal era, blending Persian, Arabic, Turkish, and local Indian dialects, and shares much of its vocabulary and grammar with Hindi. Written in a modified Persian script called Nastaliq, Urdu is renowned for its poetic tradition, especially in ghazals and romantic poetry. It serves as the national language of Pakistan and is widely used in literature, media, and education across South Asia.

                        English is a West Germanic language that originated in England and is now spoken by over 1.5 billion people worldwide. It is the dominant language in international communication, science, business, and the internet, making it a global lingua franca. English has evolved over centuries, incorporating vocabulary from Latin, French, German, and other languages, resulting in a vast and flexible lexicon. It is written in the Latin alphabet and has many regional dialects, but standardized varieties, like British and American English, are widely used in formal communication.
